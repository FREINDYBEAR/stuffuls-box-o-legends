This is a mod for Balatro

It is intended to be an expansion for Cryptid, and as such, requires Cryptid.
This adds original characters I have created and characters from other games I enjoy.
And yes, I do like Invader Zim, before you ask.
It also adds 3 new seals, and Jokers that interact with them.
You need to just drop this in your mods folder in your Balatro appdata.
This is also not going to be a tutorial for installing Balatro mods. 
The Lovely git has great instructions, found [here]([https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector])
You will never know what you will get out of the Soul ever again!

Also, all art is made by me, this is also the first time I've ever done pixel art.
